### Heart Beat Sound Classification (HBSC)

ðŸ©ºâ™¥ Heart Beat Sound Classification (HBSC) is a GraphQL API for classifying heart beats sounds in real time.

### Getting started

To test this server locally you first need to clone this repository by running the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CrispenGari/HBSC.git
```

Then:

```shell
cd HBSC/server
```

Then you need to install the packages that were used in this project. First you need to create and activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

```shell
virtualenv venv && .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Then install the packages

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run the server which is configured using `uvicorn` and `ariadne` by running the following command:

```shell
python app.py
```

The server will start on a default port of `3001` which you can configure by opening the `app.py` file and change the `AppConfig` that looks as follows:

```py
class AppConfig:
    PORT = 3001
    INFO = 'info'
```

You can change the `PORT` number if you want. But when the server is running you can test the `API` at `http://localhost:3001` using different Clients.

### Testing the API using `cURL`

If you navigate to the `audios` folder where I have `4` different audios from different classes. To test the api using `cURL` you run a graphql mutation which looks as follows:

```shell

curl http://localhost:3001 -F operations='{ "query": "mutation ClassifyHeartBeatSound($input: HeatBeatSoundInput!) { classifyHeatBeatSound(input: $input) { error { field message } ok prediction { topPrediction {  label confidence className } predictions {  label confidence className } } } }", "variables": { "input": {"audio": null} } }'  -F map='{ "0": ["variables.input.audio"] }'  -F 0=@artifact.wav
```

If everything went well you will get the following response from the server:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "classifyHeatBeatSound": {
      "error": null,
      "ok": true,
      "prediction": {
        "topPrediction": {
          "label": 0,
          "confidence": 0.9800000190734863,
          "className": "artifact"
        },
        "predictions": [
          {
            "label": 0,
            "confidence": 0.9800000190734863,
            "className": "artifact"
          },
          {
            "label": 1,
            "confidence": 0.009999999776482582,
            "className": "extrahls"
          },
          {
            "label": 2,
            "confidence": 0.009999999776482582,
            "className": "murmur"
          },
          { "label": 3, "confidence": 0.0, "className": "normal" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Heart Beat Sound Classification Model

The HBSC model was trained to do basic audio classification on heart beat sounds based on `4` classes which are:

1. artifact
2. extrahls
3. murmur
4. normal

### Notebooks

The notebook for model training can be found [here.](https://github.com/CrispenGari/torch-audio/blob/main/01_HEART_BEAT_SOUD_CLASSIFICATION/01_HEART_BEAT_SOUD_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb)

### Data

The data for training this model was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kinguistics/heartbeat-sounds)

### Model Metrics

The following metrics was obtained for the best model after training the model for `200` epochs:

```
+--------------------------------------------+
|    EPOCH: 198/200 saving best model...     |
+------------+-------+----------+------------+
| CATEGORY   |  LOSS | ACCURACY |        ETA |
+------------+-------+----------+------------+
| Training   | 0.084 |    0.977 | 0:00:00.61 |
| Validation | 0.046 |    1.000 |            |
+------------+-------+----------+------------+
```

### Classification Report Summary

The following table shows the summary of the classification report for the heart beat sound classification model training.

```
+------------+------------+-------+----------+------------+
| precision  | precision  |recall | f1-score |    support |
+------------+------------+-------+----------+------------+
| accuracy   |            |       | 100%     |    1495    |
+------------+------------+-------+----------+------------+
| macro avg  |    100%    |   100%| 100%     |    1495    |
+------------+------------+-------+----------+------------+
|weighted avg|    100%    |   100%| 100%     |    1495    |
+------------+------------+-------+----------+------------+
```

### Confusion Matrix

The following plot shows the confusion matrix that we obtained after training the model for `200` epochs on the test data.
